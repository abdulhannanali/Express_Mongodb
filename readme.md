Express_Mongodb
---------------

Hi there! This is a small application which makes use of Express framework and Mongoose to register users. This application was partially made by following the tutorial from [here](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4/)

This project was done for FOSSASIA under the umbrella of GCI (Google Code In).

Requirements:
--------------

You need to have mongodb installed on your system. This application was tested on Ubuntu 15.04

How-to:
-------

`node ./bin/www`

A tutorial will be available over at [my blog](http://yasoob.me/gci) shortly. Stay tuned!
